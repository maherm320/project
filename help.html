            <h1>How Long After Receiving My Confirmation Email Will I Be Able To Track My Order?</h1>
            <p>After you receive your shipment confirmation email, it can take up to 24 hours before you will be able to track the package online. This is because your carrier needs to scan your package before you can track it. It can take slightly longer if there's a weekend in between. Orders placed during public holidays will be processed on the following working day in Egypt.
